# Discord "Wikifier"
## Context
If you've ended up here through other means and don't know what's going on, this is a simple program to automate very specific tasks.
When copying posts from Discord onto our "mirror pages" on our WikiJS wiki, I noticed there were a lot of manual repeated steps.
This program automates many things including:
- Emoji, user, and channel tag conversion (from a known set)
- Replacement of heading formats
- Automatic conversion of timestamps
- and more.
## How to use
1. Download as Zip
2. Unzip the Zip
3. Run main.py
