Discord "Wikifier"

Context:
If you've ended up here from other sources and don't know what's going on, this is a simple program to automate very specific tasks.
When copying posts from a Minecraft server Discord onto our "mirror pages" on our WikiJS wiki, I noticed there were a lot of manual repeated steps.
This program automates many things including:
- Emoji, user, and channel tag conversion (from a known set)
- Replacement of heading formats
- Automatic conversion of timestamps
- and more.

How to install/use:
1. On the main code page of this repo, click the green "<> Code" dropdown
2. Click "Download ZIP"
3. Unzip the Zip
4. Run main.py
5. Simply paste your Discord post in and press "Wikify!"

Notes:
emoji_map.json will likely be updated relatively frequently.
user_map.json and channel_map.json may be updated occasionally.
For the least manual replacements, ensure that you have the most recent version of the file(s).
(You can download each file individually and replace the one in the original unzipped folder with the newer version).
